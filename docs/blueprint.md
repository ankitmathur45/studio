- Streak Tracking: Streak calculation display - tracking consecutive days of habit adherence (or avoidance for negative habits).
- Personalized Insights: AI-powered tool that analyzes habit tracking data and provides personalized suggestions. For example, the AI tool may suggest breaking a habit into smaller steps.
